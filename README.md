# BackTesting-Portfolio
This project demonstrates my ability to use **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas_datareader, and the Datetime module**.

The purpose of this project was to create an investment portfolio and back test its performance over the course of a customizable time frame then graph the performance of each investment unit and the portfolio as a whole.
